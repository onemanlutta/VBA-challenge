# VBA-Challenge
This project analyzes multi-stock market data for 2018, 2019 and 2020 using VBA. The goal is to create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year for each run taking the following information:

1. The ticker symbol

2. Yearly change - calculated from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

3. The percent change - derived from the opening price at the start of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

4. The total stock volume of the stock
   
5. A topline summary of the greatest % increases, greatest % decreases and the total stock volumes for that year.

## The Solution
The script iterates through all the stocks data in ago.

### Solution 1 - Ticker Symbol
The script prints the unique ticker symbols in ascending order in column "I" with a column header "Ticker.

### Solution 2 - Yearly Change
The script excutes Yearly Change from the opening price at the start of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year, putting the value in column "J". Through the code a conditional formatting is added highlighting positive change in green and negative change in red.

### Solution 3 - Precent Change
Calculates percent change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year, and puts the value in column "K".

### Solution 4 - Total stock Volume
Similarly, total stock volume gets genereated in column "L".

### Solution 5 - Greatest: ~ increase, ~ decrease, and ~ total volume
Provides the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume".
